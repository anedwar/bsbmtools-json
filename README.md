# BSBM Tools with RDF/JSON serialization

This is [BSBM Tools](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bsbmtools/) with added [RDF/JSON serialization](http://www.w3.org/2009/12/rdf-ws/papers/ws02).

> The Berlin SPARQL Benchmark (BSBM) defines a suite of benchmarks for comparing the performance of these systems across architectures. The benchmark is built around an e-commerce use case in which a set of products is offered by different vendors and consumers have posted reviews about products. The benchmark query mix illustrates the search and navigation pattern of a consumer looking for a product.

## Building

The project is built using Apache Ant and project dependencies are handled by Apache Ivy. You need to install these tools in order to build the project.

Run this first to resolve/pull dependencies:

```
apt -lib /usr/share/java resove
```

Then, build the project:

```
apt -lib /usr/share/java
```

(You don't need to specify `-lib` option if your `ivy` jars are in classpath already, or configured otherwise).

The dependencies are configured using `ivy.xml`. Note that some old dependencies reside in a not very popular maven repository, configured in `ivysettings.xml`.


## Example usage

```
./generate -fc -pc 10 -fn example -s json
```

Generated RDF/JSON samples are available in the [bsbmtools-json-samples](https://github.com/lszeremeta/bsbmtools-json-samples) repository.

You can see a list of all available options by running:

```
./generate -help
```

Additional examples are also available in the [original documentation](http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/berlinsparqlbenchmark/spec/BenchmarkRules/index.html#datagenerator).
